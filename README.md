# ofxSet
A collection of distinct objects, and some operations to go with it.

The sets use GLM classes as the base type, as I'm hoping [these will make it in the openFrameworks core soon](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/pull/4943). Have a look at the example app for reference on usage and interfacing with `ofVec#f`.
